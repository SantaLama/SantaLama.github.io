Recently I played one awesome game. It called "... But That Was [Yesterday]". Sad story about one man, who lost all he loved, his dog, friend and girlfriend. He пщуы alone in empty space to memories. In some moments you will have fun or will sad. 
Rules of game:
1) If you see black wall(your memories), you must turn away until the wall will not leave.
2) Use arrows on keyboard to move.
Winning condition:
I won't spoil you all about this game. I say only one:this game will remain in your heart for a long time
