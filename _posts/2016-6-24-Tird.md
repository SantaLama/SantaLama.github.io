Do you like a strange creatures?
Now you have got a chance to see my MONSTER!!! A little monster.
His name is Blob.Blob looks like slime ball.He can't jumping now, but he can hang on his slime rope and follow the mouse cursor.Also when Blob follow the cursor, he imprint.

This is my proggram:

void setup()

{

size(500,500);

background(0);

}

void draw()

{

// the trace

fill(0,50); //transperence of color

rect(0,0,width,height);

//Blob's form

stroke(27,222,25);

strokeWeight(10);

line(mouseX, mouseY,250,0); //mouseX and mouseY for follow

noStroke();

fill(27,222,25);

ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 140,140);

fill(255);

ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 60, 60);

fill(0);

ellipse(mouseX, mouseY,30,30);

}
