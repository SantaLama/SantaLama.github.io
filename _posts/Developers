Good morning my readers!!!
Today we talk about Producers, Designers, Engineers, Scientists and Artists. How do their roles important in team?
For beggin we need understand, what these people do:

 Second occupation on "ladder of importance" is Designer.Designers - experts in the field of design; people involved in the design, that is, appearance, design anything.In the Game Industry the designers draw backgroud for the game. They try to give realistic or cartoon for background.

Do you know who is the engineer? It's very smart man who always work with Blue Prints. But in Game  Industry they usualy work with game mechanics.For example: Moves, AI, Random, Fightings and more. Whithout these components games won't be interesting.

4. Scientist

Unlike the Engineers, Scientist study game mechanics and write game process. This records will be used for next work.

5.Artist

The last profession is Artist.Their role is draw sketches and Blue Prints for Engineers and Designers.

I think these roles very important in their team. They are interconnected and evryone can help others.
