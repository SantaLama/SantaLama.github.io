Good morning my readers!!!
Today we talk about Producers, Designers, Engineers, Scientists and Artists. How do their roles important in team?
For beggin we need understand, what these people do: 
---
1.Producer

![_config.yml]
He is head of team. He employ diffrent people to work and provide resurce for his team. Also it is important to understand that the producer does business.
---
2.Designer

 Second occupation on "ladder of importance" is Designer.Designers - experts in the field of design; people involved in the design, that is, appearance, design anything.In the Game Industry the designers draw backgroud for the game. They try to give realistic or cartoon for background.

3.Engineer
---
![_config.yml]
Do you know who is the engineer? It's very smart man who always work with Blue Prints. But in Game  Industry they usualy work with game mechanics.For example: Moves, AI, Random, Fightings and more. Whithout these components games won't be interesting.
---
4. Scientist
---
![_config.yml]
Unlike the Engineers, Scientist study game mechanics and write game process. This records will be used for next work.
---
5.Artist

The last profession is Artist.Their role is draw sketches and Blue Prints for Engineers and Designers.

I think these roles very important in their team. They are interconnected and evryone can help others.
