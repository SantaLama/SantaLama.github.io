Hello my sweety guys. My name is SantaLama.

Today in my blog I want talk about the best card game with great random and difrent combinations, about Hearthstone!!1

At firt  apply to Heartstone lore:

"It started in the inns and taverns, and the sight was always the same: two players studying the game board intently, laying down cards, smiling or snarling as they won or lost. Crowds soon gathered to watch. The game's popularity surged, and before long, you could find Hearthstone game boards all across Azeroth. You'd see players in cities, in merchant convoys, on ships at sea, in barracks and tents within military outposts. You've probably even spotted a few games in your garrison shortly after you arrived on Draenor."
